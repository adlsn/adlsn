## **Research Projects**
### 1. Design of lower limb ankle lasso exoskeleton robot

[Project Details](https://github.com/adlsn/Lower-limb-ankle-lasso-exoskeleton-robot)

#### To help the elderly usually walk, I designed a *`lasso exoskeleton robot`* in this project. The robot provides tension to the human ankle joint through a back-powered box to reduce human movement metabolism. The robot is equipped with a *`depth camera`* in front, which uses a *`semantic segmentation`* deep learning model to determine the current motion scene and optimize the motion control of the robot. The structure of the robot is shown in Figure 1.

### 2. Semantic segmentation scene perception method

[Project Details](https://github.com/adlsn/Visual-perception-control-project-of-Exoskeleton-Robot)

#### The exoskeleton robot needs to switch different gait to adapt to various terrains. The traditional human-robot interaction control method is complicated and inefficient, so I propose an exoskeleton control strategy based on visual perception control. The technique recognizes different terrains such as flat ground, stairs, etc., using a semantic segmentation deep learning model, and controls the exoskeleton by a finite state machine. The recognition effect of the method is shown in Figure 2.

### 3. Research on visual perception of spherical robots

[Project Details](https://github.com/adlsn/Lower-limb-ankle-lasso-exoskeleton-robot)

#### The spherical robot is a reconnaissance robot, so it needs to have a strong environment perception capability. The spherical robot is composed of two symmetrical flywheel mechanisms with cameras mounted on both sides. In this project, I focused on the panoramic stitching technique under binocular vision and the target detection technique under HSV color space. Figure 5 shows the 3D design and prototype of the robot.

### 4. Study on tactile sEMG signal of exoskeleton gloves

[Project Details](https://github.com/adlsn/sEMG-processing-software-design)

#### This project designed a hand exoskeleton to help rehabilitate patients with hand disorders. In this project, I developed a 3D signal construction method using human surface electromyogram (sEMG) signals as a neural network input. I built a full-dimensional convolutional analysis network to output the hand motion intention.
