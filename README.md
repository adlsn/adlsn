## 1. Stream Surface Clustering using GCN

[Project Details](https://github.com/adlsn/Surf-Patch)

#### The surface of a stream is formed by particles in a 3D flow field, which can include data such as tornadoes, Bernard cells, and swirls. Our project aims to identify and analyze these stream surface features using multiple `surfpatches` and grouping them based on their unique patterns. This will help domain experts to better understand and analyze similar surfaces.
