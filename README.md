### 1. Design of lower limb ankle lasso exoskeleton robot
To help the elderly usually walk, I designed a lasso exoskeleton robot in this project. The robot provides tension to the human ankle joint through a back-powered box to reduce human movement metabolism. The robot is equipped with a depth camera in front, which uses a semantic segmentation deep learning model to determine the current motion scene and optimize the motion control of the robot. The structure of the robot is shown in Figure 1.
